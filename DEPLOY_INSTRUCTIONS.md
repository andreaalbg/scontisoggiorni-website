# 🚀 Deployment Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `sconticucine-website` (or your choice)
3. Description: "Sconti Cucine website - Next.js 14 with SEO optimization"
4. Visibility: Public or Private
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Code to GitHub

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/andreaalbagli/Documents/BEhome-1

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sconticucine-website.git

# Push code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If git asks for credentials, you may need to use a Personal Access Token instead of password:
- Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Generate new token (classic)
- Select "repo" scope
- Use token as password when prompted
